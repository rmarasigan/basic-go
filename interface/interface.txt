An interface is similar to a struct in that it combines one or more elements but rather than defining a type in terms of the data items it contains, an interface defines it in terms of a set of method signatures which it must implement.

Once declared an interface can be used just like any other declared type, allowing functions and variables to operate with unkown types based solely on their required behaviour.


type Reader interface {
	Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Writer interface {
	Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type ReadWriter interface {
	Reader
	Writer
}

Here io is declaring three (3) interfaces, the Reader and Writer which are independent of each other and the ReadWriter which combines both. Anytime we declare a variable, field or function parameter in terms of a ReadWriter we know we can use both the Read() and Write() methods to manipulate it.
